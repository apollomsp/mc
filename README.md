# Microsoft Message Center Collector

An automated GitHub Actions workflow that collects Microsoft 365 service announcements and health messages from the Message Center and stores them in a public repository for consumption by *DeltaPulse*.

## Overview

This repository automatically fetches Microsoft 365 Message Center data every 8 hours using the Microsoft Graph API and stores it as a JSON file. The collected data includes service announcements, maintenance notifications, and other important Microsoft 365 service communications.

## Features

- üîÑ **Automated Collection**: Runs every 8 hours via GitHub Actions
- üìÑ **Pagination Support**: Handles large datasets by fetching all pages of results
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Uses Azure AD app registration with client credentials
- üìä **Clean Data Format**: Stores only the message array for easy consumption

## Data Format

The collected data is stored in `service-messages.json` as a JSON array containing Microsoft 365 Message Center items. Each message includes:

- Message ID and classification
- Service affected (Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, etc.)
- Message title and body
- Start and end times
- Severity level
- Tags and additional metadata

## Usage
