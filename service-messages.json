The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p>[Next Steps:]\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>"

To avoid disruptions, we strongly urge you to transition to OneNote on Windows (OneNote for Microsoft 365) and recommend uninstalling OneNote for Windows 10 as part of this process to avoid user confusion.

Starting in June 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 may experience changes to their sync behavior due to updates in security and services, which may require reopening notebooks to resume syncing. Additionally, the sync experience on OneNote for Windows 10 may be slower compared to OneNote on Windows.\n</li><li><b>A Smooth Transition Experience</b>: Starting in July 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 will receive in-app banner notifications guiding them to switch to OneNote for Microsoft 365 ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in their workflow.</li></ul><p>[What you can do to prepare:]</p><p>To help your users transition smoothly, we recommend starting the migration process now.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-October 2025 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p> \n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:] \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

With hotpatch updates, you can quickly take measures to help protect your organization from cyberattacks, while minimizing user disruptions. You’ll first create a hotpatch-enabled quality update policy in Windows Autopatch through the Microsoft Intune console.

Soon, Copilot will also allow users to choose how they want to listen: select one or two speakers, adjust the style from concise to playful, and tailor the length to short, medium, or long.

This is a major improvement over the current experience which relies on end-users to manually set their work location. When this feature is configured and enabled, Teams can automatically update the work location of users who connect their laptop to your organization's Wi-Fi network or peripherals. The feature can leverage the mapping between your building names and your Wi-Fi networks to set the work location of your users to the right building. It can also leverage mappings to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bookable-desks\" target=\"_blank\">specific peripherals</a>, such as monitors. Teams uses the same policy to enable or disable automatic updates of work location for Wi-Fi and peripherals.

If you are currently following this guidance, <b>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain</b>.\n</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.\n</li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

If you are currently following this guidance, <b>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.&nbsp;</b></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences. You can refer them to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-cloud-microsoft-7ba4c8b9-d062-4444-84a5-fca6c3006d2b\" target=\"_blank\">What is cloud.microsoft? - Microsoft Support</a> for more information.&nbsp;</li><li>If your organizational websites, tools, or other materials reference the old URL, those links will be automatically redirected. However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.&nbsp;</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. &nbsp;</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks. This should require no action if standard <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft network guidance on domains and service endpoints</a> is being followed.&nbsp;</li></ul>"

Whether you're scheduling messages, managing approvals, syncing updates across apps, or triggering actions from chat messages, Workflows makes it easy to build automations in just a few clicks. It’s powered by Power Automate and designed to help you stay focused on what matters most.</p><p>This new version addresses previous concerns around complexity and performance, delivering a faster, more intuitive, and streamlined interface.

We have adjusted our roadmap to address your needs and concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting September 1, 2025, Microsoft 365 Copilot will start remembering key highlights from your person-to-person communications in chats, emails, and meetings.

It’s also removed from Windows Server 2025 starting with the September 2025 security update. Windows Insider preview builds already reflect this change as of July 2025. Windows PowerShell 2.0 is over 14 years old, lacks many security enhancements of the later versions, and has been deprecated since 2017.

For most users and organizations, this change will be uneventful – newer versions of PowerShell (5.1 and 7.x) continue to be available and supported.

Changes to private channel limits and meeting scheduling will follow in February 2026. Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed. This post will be updated soon with details on the PowerShell command.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out private channel migration early October 2025 (previously late September) and expect to complete by late January 2026 (previously mid-December 2025).

Users who try to browse files or manage their OneDrive libraries will be promoted to install the OneDrive app. This in-app notification will roll out to TestFlight users at the end of August and become generally available the week of September 15, 2025. This is a modification from the initial post to allow our enterprise customers more time to prepare.</p><p>The second phase of this change updates the Word, PowerPoint and Excel functionality in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with previewers that will be made available to TestFlight users only in October and GA rollout will begin mid-October 2025. This will be a gradual, phased rollout that will take about 4 weeks or so to reach 100% of customers. These changes only apply to iPhone for now, iPad will see similar changes with a start of TestFlight in early November, and the start of the GA rollout in mid November. For iPad we will have a phased rollout that gradually ramps up to 100% of GA in about 4 weeks time.</p><p>To get early builds and test out features before GA dates – you will need to join the iOS TestFlight program for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.  There are a limited number of seats available in the iOS TestFlight program. We periodically remove inactive users (those who have not updated their build) to make space for others. If you are unable to join because the program is full, please check back later, or contact your Microsoft Support representative.

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps. Users of the M365 Copilot app will continue to be able to browse and search recent files in the app, but users seeking comprehensive file management features will be encouraged to utilize the OneDrive app. When users land in the M365 Copilot app Search experience and navigate to the My files, Libraries, or My device entry points a notification will appear promoting the use of the OneDrive app for these actions.\n</p><p>Detailed Change Log: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, M365 Copilot App \n</p><ul><li>Word, Excel, PowerPoint: The Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iPhone and iPad will a provide a Copilot powered preview experience for documents. Users can view content and use Copilot Chat for file queries. Users who wish to edit the file will be prompted to open or install the standalone apps.\n</li><li>M365 Copilot App: The M365 Copilot app has evolved to an AI-first productivity assistant that brings together productivity activity across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. It gives your users the power of file previews and M365 Copilot chat in an experience that inherits all the security, identity and privacy policies you’ve set up in Microsoft 365.</li><li>Teams, OneDrive, Outlook iOS app integration: These apps on iPhone and iPad will continue to show users a preview of their Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. If users want to open and edit a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file, they will now be directed to the respective standalone Word, Excel or PowerPoint app. The M365 Copilot app will no longer handle file open and edit operations from Teams, OneDrive or Outlook.</li><li> File Management: Searching for files within the M365 Copilot app will remain available. For advanced file management, users will be directed to the standalone OneDrive app. \n</li><li>Create Experience: Document creation in the M365 Copilot app will be available from chat.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>IT Administrators will be able to set up Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Windows applications to limit the creation of new files to only Cloud Locations (OneDrive, SharePoint, or third-party Clouds). \n</p><p>This configuration is called <code>enablecloudonlysaveasmode</code><b style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"></b>  is available only to IT Administrators and deployed using Group Policies. This policy is available now in the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030\" target=\"_blank\">Administrative Template files for Microsoft Office</a> (version 5516.1000 or newer). \n</p><p>For the policy to apply, users should be using a Windows version of Word, Excel and PowerPoints Version 2506 (Build 19029.20000) or newer.  \n</p><p>This new Policy is part of a new set of tools for IT Administrators to move their organizations towards higher Cloud usage and <b>Increase security and compliance</b>:  Files in the Cloud are automatically protected by your company’s security rules and labeling, so you don’t have to take extra steps to keep them safe and compliant.  \n</p><p>This policy setting controls whether Word, Excel, and PowerPoint users can use non-Cloud locations (local and network) to create new files. If you enable this policy setting, users will only have Cloud Locations available to perform <i style=\"\">Save As</i> and <i>Save new files</i>. If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, users can use any location (Cloud, Local, and Network) to perform <i>Save As</i> and <i>Save new files</i>. Note: This policy setting only applies to subscription versions of Office, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><ul><li><b>Public Preview: </b>We will begin rolling out late August 2025 and expect to complete by mid-September 2025. \n</li><li><b>General Availability</b> (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, and DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2025 and is now expected to complete by end of December 2025 (previously late September).</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>If you do nothing, this change will have no impact on your organization. \n</p><p>If you enable the new Policy, Office will limit the creation of new Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files to Cloud Locations; <i>Save </i>and <i>Save a Copy</i> operations will only present Cloud locations and all local destinations will disappear from Office programs.  \n</p><p><img src=\" https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3401498a-887b-40aa-a85e-f5a17876dcfe\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>If Known Folders have been redirected to OneDrive (KFM), these folders are considered Cloud folders and they will be available for <i>Save </i>and <i>Save a Copy</i> operations. \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>If your organization already keep all Office files in the Cloud, this policy will prevent users from accidentally saving files outside of the Cloud. \n</p><p>If users in your organization still use local files, this policy will promote the creation of new files in the Cloud and prevent additional files to be created locally. You can communicate this change to end users explaining the advantages of saving the files to the Cloud instead of saving to local folders: \n</p><ul><li>Easy collaboration: It’s easy to work with others—just share your Cloud file to start collaborating right away. You and your team can add comments and make changes together, and AutoSave keeps your work updated in real time. \n</li><li>Never lose your progress: Don’t worry about losing your work—files in the Cloud include AutoSave on, meaning your documents are automatically saved for you as you work.​ \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Files you create in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on Windows are instantly available from your Mac, web browser, iPhone, or Android device. When you make changes on one device, they are available from everywhere.  \n</li></ul><p>To minimize impact on users, we recommend moving (redirecting) known folders to OneDrive (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/redirect-known-folders\" target=\"_blank\">Redirect and move Windows known folders to OneDrive - SharePoint in Microsoft 365</a>) \n</p><p>To deploy this policy: \n</p><p>If you use  Active Directory, Microsoft Entra or hybrid environments,  you can use Group Policy Objects.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We hear your feedback about ways we can improve the notifications experience in Viva Engage. It's always a fine balance between ensuring your users are notified of relevant content without notifications feeling too overwhelming or noisy. In response to your feedback, we're rolling out an intelligent notifications experience. Specifically, this change will improve how <i>Community Announcement</i> notifications are delivered. This smarter delivery approach optimizes notifications delivery based on a user’s engagement behavior, helping to reduce notifications fatigue while ensuring timely visibility of announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b><b></b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this change in mid-September 2025 and expect the rollout to reach GA (General Availability) by end of January 2026.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b>\n</p><p>Previously, when an admin created a new Community Announcement, this would send a notification in Teams and Mobile Push immediately, followed by an email notification two hours later if the announcement was not opened already in Teams and/or Mobile Push.&nbsp;\nWith this new update:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Users will now receive the notification in <b>one channel only</b>—either Teams, Mobile Push, or Email. This notification channel may differ by user and is selected based on where a user has engaged with Engage notifications most frequently in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</li><li>If the announcement is not opened within two hours in the first notification channel, a <b>secondary notification channel</b> will be sent, also determined by where a user engages with Engage notifications most frequently.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We will continue to respect all user notification preferences and settings where applicable. If a notification channel is disabled or the app is not installed, it will not be selected as a potential notification channel for the Community Announcement delivery.</p><p>Note that this change applies only to<b> regular Community Announcements in Viva Engage</b> and does not affect the \"immediate\" Community Announcement feature (where admins can still select the checkbox to send emails immediately —this functionality remains unchanged).</p><p><b>Can I still notify Community users via email immediately (along with other notification channels)?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! In Viva Engage, we offer an option to send an “immediate” Community Announcement. With this feature, Community admins can choose to send email notifications immediately after posting a Community Announcement, even if a user has opted out of receiving emails. All other notification channels will also send immediately along with email, including Teams and Mobile Push. Therefore, we recommend admins to use this feature when there is a Community Announcement that requires immediate attention from users.&nbsp;</p><p>Community Admins can find this “immediate” Community Announcement option by firstly navigating to the announcement publisher and selecting the hyperlinked <b><i>“option to send emails immediately” </i></b>at the bottom of the publisher. Upon clicking this option, an additional pop-up box will open called <i><b>“Immediate email delivery”</b></i>. By selecting this checkbox, this will ensure that all three notification channels – Email, Teams, and Mobile Push – will send to customers immediately after a Community Announcement is made.&nbsp;</p><p><b>\n&nbsp;What you can do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Informing your users about the new notifications change to reduce confusion</li>\n<li>Monitoring user feedback and engagement with <i>Community Announcements' notifications delivery</i></li>\n<li>Reviewing internal communication strategies to align with the new notification's behavior</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Yes. Notification delivery logic now uses user behavior data (last 30 days of notification engagement) to determine delivery channels. This data is used to personalize delivery but is not stored permanently.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. The system uses behavioral data to determine the most effective notification channel, which is a form of machine learning-based personalization.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change provide a new way of communicating between users, tenants, or subscriptions?</td><td>Yes. The change modifies how users receive communications (Community Announcements) by introducing a dynamic, behavior-based delivery method.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>"

With this update, you can assign custom external access policies to users or groups with five configuration options:</p><ul><li><i>Use organization settings</i>: Inherits the tenant’s default external access configuration</li><li><i>Allow all external domains</i>: All external organizations are trusted</li><li><i>Allow only specific external domains</i>: Only domains in the allow list are trusted</li><li><i>Block only specific external domains</i>: Domains in the block list are restricted; all others are trusted</li><li><i>Block all</i>: All external domains are blocked for users assigned to this policy</li></ul><p>Users assigned a custom policy may interact with different external domains than those defined in the organization-wide settings.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare</b></p><p>Administrators should begin identifying users and groups that require differentiated external access and plan pilot scenarios accordingly.</p><p>During the public preview, configuration must be done via PowerShell using the following cmdlets:</p><ul><li><code>Set-CsExternalAccessPolicy</code></li><li><code>Set-CsTenantFederationConfiguration</code></li></ul><p><i>Note: </i>Changes made through these cmdlets will not be reflected in the Teams admin center UI during the Targeted Release.</p><p>Once the feature reaches general availability, the Teams admin center UI will support these configurations, allowing policy management via both PowerShell and the UI.</p><p>Learn more:</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat?tabs=user-policies#configure-granular-domains-in-external-access-policies\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">IT Admins - Manage external meetings and chat with people and organizations using Microsoft identities - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>Admin control via Entra ID group membership</td>\n  <td>Policies can be assigned to Entra ID groups for targeted external access control.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>Admin control via Entra ID group membership</td>\n  <td>Policies can be assigned to Entra ID groups for targeted external access control.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>"

This feature will reach general availability on December 10, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This feature allows you to configure external threat detection systems for enhanced oversight. These tools operate during the agent's run-time, continuously evaluating agent activity. If the system detects any tools or actions it deems suspicious, it can intervene to approve or block their execution, providing an extra layer of real-time protection and compliance enforcement.<br><br>With the flexibility provided by this feature, users can select Microsoft Defender, integrate with other trusted security partners, or develop and connect your own custom monitoring solutions. Admins can enable this feature using the following steps:<ol><li><b>Register a Microsoft Entra application</b>: A Power Platform Administrator creates an Entra app to securely authenticate between Copilot Studio and the chosen external monitoring provider. This can be done using a provided PowerShell script or manually through the Azure portal.</li><li><b>Configure integration in Power Platform Admin Center</b>: The administrator enters the Entra app details and the REST API endpoint from the security partner in the Admin Center’s threat detection settings.</li></ol>Once enabled, Copilot Studio shares only the necessary runtime data with the external provider for real-time decision-making. The integration can be disabled at any time if requirements change. External threat detection is available only for generative agents using generative orchestration (not classic agents).<br><br>Organizations are responsible for ensuring their chosen provider’s data handling and compliance standards meet internal and regulatory requirements.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12592\">Enable external threat detection and protection for Copilot Studio custom agents (preview)</a>."

These self-service trial licenses will be a part of your Microsoft organizational tenant, and you will be able to manage these licenses like other Microsoft subscriptions. You will be able to cancel these trial licenses at any time.</p><p>You will also be able to fully control whether trials are converted to paid subscriptions. Users will not need to input payment information when signing up. If a user would like to convert to a paid license, they must work with you directly to do so as there is no auto-renew functionality for these trials. If a user isn’t upgraded to a paid subscription, all services included in their Microsoft Teams Premium will end, and the user may lose read only access to data generated by Teams Premium, stored in Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.<br></p><p>Users in tenants where self-service trials are disabled may still see the “Get Premium” prompt when accessing features that require a premium license. This is expected behavior and helps signal user interest to admins. It can also help identify which users in your organization may need a Teams Premium license, allowing you to better manage and allocate your available licenses.&nbsp; To reduce confusion and prevent users from submitting license requests, admins can customize the license request flow. Instead of showing the default request form, they can configure a custom message explaining that license requests are not supported in their organization.

These are hosted in physically separated data centers with independent power, cooling, and networking, in compliance with legislated data residency regulations. Since the replication across the zones is synchronous, if there is any failure in a zone or loss of a zone, the customer traffic will seamlessly and automatically move to the other zones, and the customers will not see any outage. <br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nWe encourage you to maintain documented business continuity and disaster recovery plans for your implementation.

With this release, Planner adds enforcement for content‑level labels (block copy/print/export, read‑only, etc.) on plans and tasks consistent with Microsoft Purview policies and RMS usage rights.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> Which plan types are covered and when?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Rollout begins with Roster Plans followed by Group‑backed Plans.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> Do I need to change any Purview policies or configurations?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> No changes are required for existing labels; however, you should review label protection settings (e.g., copy/print/export restrictions) and confirm RMS usage rights align with expected Planner behaviors. Update governance guidance accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> How does this interact with Loop and Teams meeting notes/TLC?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Loop meeting notes apply a single content label across the page and its components (including Task List components (TLC)). Planner now inherits and enforces those restrictions on the corresponding roster plan, preventing prior sync breaks when restrictive labels were applied.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> What happens to guest/external users under different label combinations?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Container labels determine who can be added; content labels determine what actions are permitted. For example, guests can be added when the container allows it, but content‑level restrictions may prevent plan access or actions (copy/export/print).</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> Who can change a plan’s sensitivity label?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Typically, owners/editors with the appropriate rights can change labels. Permissions are enforced service‑side and reflected in the UI according to RMS usage rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><b>[Compliance considerations:]</b></p>\n<p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>"

Currently CSP is applied in reporting mode but as of March 1, 2026, the Content Security Policy will be enforced which will prevent the loading of script (e.g. JavaScript) from non-allowed sources. This message center post replaces MC1055557 (April 2024).</p><p>This change is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=485797\" target=\"_blank\">485797</a></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>This will be implemented starting March 1, 2026.</p><p>\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>If your organization extended SharePoint Online using SPFx then the created custom SPFx solutions could potentially load scripts from locations which are not allowed. In most cases SPFx solutions use and load script from allowed locations, but that’s not always the case. Any script from a not allowed location will be blocked, the same applies for any inline script usage. SPFx solutions whose script is getting blocked will not function anymore as designed, impacting business scenarios depending on those solutions.\n</p><p>To prevent solutions from breaking there you need to:\n</p><ol><li>Ensure all used script locations are trusted script sources. This can be done without updating the SPFx solution\n</li><li>Move all inline script to script files which can then be defined as trusted source. <b>This will require updating the SPFx solution!\n</b></li></ol><p>If you need more time to review your SPFx solutions, there’s an option to postpone CSP enforcement by 90 days via below SPO Management Shell PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -DelayContentSecurityPolicyEnforcement $true</code>\n</p><p>Note:\n</p><p>This option will be available in the SPO Management Shell version 16.0.26712.12000 (November 2025) or higher.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>In addition to the default CSP settings, SharePoint Online will add locations listed in the Trusted Script Sources area of the SharePoint Online Admin Center as valid locations for CSP, thus enabling script loading from those locations. To add an entry, in a browser, go to the Trusted Script Sources via SharePoint Online Admin Center &gt; Advanced &gt; Script sources.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/65be05c0-aa60-4cd8-8c3d-cbf18cddbb73 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>To understand which script location to add there are two options. First option is testing your SPFx solutions with the browser dev tools console open. As CSP is in reporting mode until March 1, 2026, there will be messages indicating script that will be blocked once CSP is enforced. These messages start with “Loading the script '&lt;path to script&gt;' violates the following…” or “Executing inline script violates the following Content Security Policy directive…”. \n</p><p>Whenever the browser logs a CSP violation, that violation is also logged to <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview</a>. In the browser, navigate to the Audit solution in Microsoft Purview from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. From the Search page, search for the Activity - friendly names value Violated Content Security Policy, or the Activity - operation names value ViolatedContentSecurityPolicy:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ece7b2ac-44f9-4abe-b95f-426e20ab77bf \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Selecting a search result opens the side panel with the audit details. Take note of the following properties:</p><ul><li><b>DocumentUrl:</b> This indicates the page in the SharePoint Online site where the CSP violation occurred.</li><li><b>BlockedUrl:</b> This indicates the URL of the script that violated the CSP configuration or contains “inline” when the violation came from loading inline script\n</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/1818988a-08d8-4e41-802e-9abdc94ec2c5 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><b><u>Important\n</u></b></p><p>In the case of inline script, the remediation requires updating the SPFx solution by moving inline script into a separate script file, which then can be added as a trusted source.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/spfx/csp\" target=\"_blank\">Support for Content Security Policy (CSP) in SharePoint Online</a>&nbsp;</p>"

They provide the ability to standardize content while allowing easy customization for specific scenarios.</li><li><b>Project manager agent </b>will now be available in all plans for M365 Copilot licensed users, including basic plans.</li></ul><p><b>Features in Planner that will be retired:</b></p>\n<ul><li>We expect this rollout to begin between <b>mid-January 2026</b> and <b>mid-February 2026</b>.</li><li>The following changes will take effect as this build rolls out to your organization:</li><ul><li><b>A new <i>Task chat experience </i>will replace the prior <i>comments experience </i>for <i>basic plan</i> tasks:</b> <ul><li>As noted above, the previous task comments experience will be replaced by a new task chat feature that supports messages about the task that can include @mentions and rich text formatting, in response to a longstanding top customer request. Due to customer feedback on our notifications experience, the new chat feature only sends an email/Teams notification to a colleague that’s been @mentioned in the message. </li><li>The task chat experience will be available on Planner in Teams web/desktop and the Planner web experience, and the old experience for viewing comments will no longer be directly visible on a task. Instead, the task details pane will show a link to open a page in Outlook where task comments can be seen.</li><li>Users can continue to use and see the previous task comments experience in the iOS Planner app, Android Planner app, and Planner in Teams mobile.

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph. </p><p>In September 2023, we announced that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests to Exchange Online. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are now less than 18 months from October 1, 2026. We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]</p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>"

This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out January 2026 (previously mid-May 2025) and expect to complete by end of January 2026 (previously late May 2025). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.&nbsp;</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out February 2026 (previously early August 2025) and expect to complete by end of February 2026 (previously late October 2025).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>"

In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time.

We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> [How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]<br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>"

Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations.

Until now, IT admins configured availability settings separately in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC) and the Teams Admin Center (TAC), which led to mismatches. With this update, you’ll be able to unify availability policies for apps and agents across both portals, making app management more consistent and efficient<b>.</b></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">393931</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\" target=\"_blank\">503105</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:\n</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature late September 2025 and expect to complete by end of June 2026 (previously mid-November 2025).</p><p>1. <b>Phase 1 – Default Tenant Unification</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature at the end of September 2025. This initial phase targets tenants that have never modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Teams admin center.  At the end of this phase, agent and app manageability will be unified across both Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center ensuring agent and Microsoft 365 <b>apps availability</b> policies are in alignment for all future administrative changes.

We will update this post with a timeline and more details later.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers.

If different departments within your organization manage these settings, we suggest coordinating efforts to complete the review collaboratively.\n</p><p>This update will be rolled out automatically by the stated date, and no immediate action is required.

A setting will be added in the Intune admin center for admins to easily migrate devices, along with reporting to show which devices need to be moved. Devices will automatically be migrated in calendar year 2026 if no action is taken.&nbsp;</li><li>The Intune app and Android Device Policy app will install and users will see notifications on their device about the installation. <b>Note:</b> The Android Device Policy app will be hidden on the device and users will not be able to view or launch the app.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are using username and password for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise#enterprise-personally-owned-work-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi policies</a>, after the device has been migrated, users will lose access to corporate Wi-Fi until they sign in again. We recommend using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/certificates-configure\" target=\"_blank\">certificate authentication</a> as a more secure method and minimize disruption to your users.&nbsp;</li><li>The work profile settings ‘Display work contact caller-id in personal profile’ and ‘Search work contacts from personal profile’ will become one setting, if either are set to <b>Block</b>, Intune will automatically configure this to block for devices on the Android Management API. Once all devices are using the new API the user interface will be updated accordingly.&nbsp;</li><li>Screen timeouts can be configured either for the device or for the work profile under ‘Maximum minutes of inactivity until work profile locks’. After devices are migrated it will only be configurable in the work profile setting. If you have configured the setting in both, it will use the lesser of the two.&nbsp;</li><li>Devices on the Android Management API will not receive policies preventing users from using biometrics or trust agents to unlock their device. However, policies that prevent this at the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal#work-profile-password\" target=\"_blank\">work profile level</a> will still be supported and should be used as an alternative if you have this configured at the device level. </li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition and the most streamlined experience for your users, we recommend as applicable:  \n</p><ul><li>Reviewing the changes listed and revising any relevant policy configurations \n</li><li>Update your IT admin documentation \n</li><li>Notify your users or helpdesk about the changes in experience \n</li></ul><p>We will provide more specific timeframes and additional information in the coming months to give you adequate time to prepare.
